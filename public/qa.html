                    <p><span><b>ALEX WURZ</b>, ESC SAFETY AMBASSADOR_</span> I’d love to see us racing in Vienna – just because I’ve already got the perfect track layout in my mind; right in the city centre, beside the parliament buildings and the university. Putting a track in a location like that really hits all the targets: micromobility-friendly, city-centric and adaptive to new technology. It’s perfect.</p>
                    <p><span><b>KHALIL BESCHIR</b>, ESC COO_ </span> Yeah, I agree. Vienna would be perfect for eSC. We want to be in cities that are already adopting micromobility – and then also look towards forward-thinking cities that see the potential of the sector. </p>

                    <p><span><b>HRAG SARKISSIAN</b>, ESC CEO_ </span>That’s right, Lucas – we know the big micromobility pioneers – places like Paris and Berlin. And, in an ideal world, we’d be racing in Paris, London, Vienna, Berlin, Copenhagen, Lisbon, Rome/Milan, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco, Dubai, Shanghai, Sao Paolo and Mexico City.</p>

                    <p><span><b>KHALIL_</b></span> Absolutely, but we also want to help cities who aren’t yet involved in the sector – places we feel we could develop together. We’re already talking to several cities who are looking to use eSC as a means to further introduce micromobility to their landscape, and there are plenty more discussions to be had.</p>
                    <p><span><b>DAKOTA ‘KOTA’ SCHUETZ</b>, ESC RIDER AMBASSADOR_ </span> Strongly agree with Khalil. It’s about balancing those cities with a strong micromobility footprint with places that want to look to the future.</p>

                    <p><span><b>HRAG_</b></span> Yeah, I mean, that’s definitely correct from a practical perspective. But I also think a bigger political paradigm shift is needed. It’s about giving people more real mobility choices, human-centric planning and infrastructure supported by policies that help create more liveable cities. </p>

                    <p><span><b>ALEX_ </b></span> Many forward-thinking cities are already planning and adjusting their road and pedestrian networks, its a growing global movement. Concern about air quality and pollution is making us reimagine our streets and fast-track new attitudes to mobility. Micromobility is simply the next step. </p>
                    <p><span><b>LUCAS_ </b></span> Yeah, what the others have said, basically. To make it really work properly, micromobility needs infrastructure and safety controls – things like dedicated bike/scooter lanes, mandatory helmet rules, GPS tracking with fines to give riders responsibility. And a tighter regulation and safety framework for the scooters themselves.</p>

                    <p><span><b>HARAG_</b> </span> First, I think Kota’s done an incredible job of developing the eSkootr, and I believe we have a really nicely balanced and fast scooter.

                    <p><span><b>LUCAS_</b></span> Yeah, retaining a similarity to real-world eScooters is important. I think it will help with the public’s perception of the product.</p>
                    <p><span><b>KHALIL_</b></span> Actually, I think that familiarity means that the speed is even more apparent. It already looks properly quick, but we’re now working to make it even faster.
